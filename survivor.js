/**
 * Task:
 *
 * You are in a room with a circle of 100 chairs. The chairs are numbered
 * sequentially from 1 to 100.
 *
 * At some point in time, the person in chair #1 will be asked to leave. The
 * person in chair #2 will be skipped, and the person in chair #3 will be asked
 * to leave. This pattern of skipping one person and asking the next to leave
 * will keep going around the circle until there is one person leftâ€¦ the
 * survivor.
 *
 * Write a program to determine which chair the survivor is sitting in?
 *
 *
 * Below are two solutions one is a bullet prof brute force (which has a O(n)
 * complexity for both memory and time), the other one is a little bit more
 * intelligent (which is basically a O(1) for memory and time).
