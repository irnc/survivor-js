/**
 * Task:
 *
 * You are in a room with a circle of 100 chairs. The chairs are numbered
 * sequentially from 1 to 100.
 *
 * At some point in time, the person in chair #1 will be asked to leave. The
 * person in chair #2 will be skipped, and the person in chair #3 will be asked
 * to leave. This pattern of skipping one person and asking the next to leave
 * will keep going around the circle until there is one person leftâ€¦ the
 * survivor.
 *
 * Write a program to determine which chair the survivor is sitting in?
 *
 *
 * Below are two solutions (written in JavaScript for node.js and modern Web
 * browsers) one is a bullet prof brute force (which has a O(n) complexity for
 * both memory and time), the other one is a little bit more intelligent (which
 * is basically a O(1) for memory and time).
 *
 * Test results for a 100 chairs:
 *     The survivor are sitting in a chair #72
 *     brute force method: 5ms
 *     The survivor are sitting in a chair #72
 *     intelligent method: 0ms
 *
 * Test results for a 1,000,000 chairs:
 *     The survivor are sitting in a chair #951424
 *     brute force method: 106ms
 *     The survivor are sitting in a chair #951424
 *     intelligent method: 0ms
